# Welcome to the LMOS Sample Agents Repository

## Agents

The following agents are available in this repository:

- [News Agent](./news-agent) (`news-agent`): Retrieves the latest news headlines from a given URL.
- [Weather Agent](./weather-agent) ('weather-agent`): Retrieves the current weather forecast for a given location.
- [Technical Specifications Agent](./techspec-agent) (`techspec-agent`): Defines technical specifications from a requirements description.
- [Product Search Agent](./productsearch-agent) (`productsearch-agent`): Searches for products that match given technical specifications.

## How to Run

#### 1. Set your OpenAI API Key

The sample agents are set up to use the OpenAI API to access the GPT-4o-mini language model. To use the agents, you need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. You can sign up for an API key at https://platform.openai.com/signup.

Then simply export the API key as an environment variable.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY]
```

#### 2. Start the Application

Choose one of the agents and start it like a normal Spring Boot application.
This requires the port 8080 to be available.

```bash
  ./gradlew :<[agent-name]>:bootRun
```
e.g.
```bash
  ./gradlew :news-agent:bootRun
```
for the news agent.

#### 3. Access the Agent

The sample agents are built with [Arc](https://eclipse-lmos.github.io/arc/) and can be accessed via a Graphiql interface.
Open http://localhost:8080/graphiql?path=/graphql

Example request for the news agent:

```graphql
subscription {
    agent(
        request: {
            conversationContext: {
                conversationId: "1"
            }
            systemContext: [],
            userContext: {
                userId: "1234",
                profile: []
            },
            messages: [
                {
                    role: "user",
                    content: "What are the headlines at https://www.theregister.com/ today?",
                    format: "text",
                }
            ]
        }
    ) {
        messages {
            content
        }
    }
}
```
